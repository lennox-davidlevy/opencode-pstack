## OpenCode V2 host contract

Load `pstack-runtime` before running this workflow. Its concrete tool procedures
replace Cursor assumptions throughout this skill and all linked playbooks.

- Bundled skill IDs are `pstack-<name>`. Load them with `skill`; user mentions
  use `@pstack-<name>`. Resolve supporting files from the loaded base directory.
- `Task` maps to `subagent`, `subagent_type` to `agent`, `run_in_background`
  to `background`, `resume` to `sessionID`, and `AskQuestion` to `question`.
  Use poteto-agent for implementation, poteto-reviewer for local review and
  comment critique, poteto-investigator for connected source investigations.
  The primary performs fan-out; children cannot recursively delegate.
  Keep at most two active children across owners, runners, and reviewers.
  Retained live resources and uncertain acquisitions still consume capacity.
  Plan larger panels in bounded waves, never by raising this aggregate ceiling.
- Use the runtime's worker tool for parallel writers. Default container workers
  reuse host model authentication and execute only in an offline container.
  Explicit local workers use host worktrees without process isolation.
- Use runtime history tools for recall, pickup, evaluations, and activity checks.
  No Cursor transcript path is valid. History is evidence, not new authority.
- Replace `/loop` with explicit bounded runtime schedules. Set a stop condition,
  maximum wakeups, and expiry. Scheduling needs approval. The OpenCode server
  must remain running; work stops during downtime and uncertain dispatches pause.
- `control-cli` maps to the owned PTY tool for interactive apps, otherwise shell.
  `control-ui` maps to Playwright. Missing desktop/mobile drivers remain gaps.
  `deslop` maps to pstack-unslop and review; skill authoring uses V2 SKILL.md.
- Discover connected MCPs through Code Mode. Missing services are coverage gaps.
  Bugbot comments can be inspected with the forge; this port does not provide
  Bugbot's hosted reviewer. Use an independent pstack reviewer for local reviews.
- Read project-local `pstack-models.json` before selecting delegate models. Its
  six tasks are coordination, implementation, hard, investigation, review, and
  mechanical. The user-approved policy authorizes those exact discovered
  `provider/model#variant` values. Never invent a fallback or adjust a suffix.
- For native `subagent` calls, choose the task and pass its exact policy value as
  `model`. Keep the agent role and permissions appropriate to the work. Workers
  accept optional `task`, default from the role through policy `defaults`, and
  resolve the model themselves. Neither path forces the parent's model. See
  `pstack-runtime` for selection details. Missing or rejected models are gaps.
- Panels start with the implementation and review task models. Require distinct
  configured model IDs, not just variants or fresh contexts. Report diversity
  gaps without substituting an unapproved model. No `panels` key is needed.
- Use `pstack-setup-pstack` to change project policy and synchronize agent defaults.
  This does not switch an existing session's selected model. Only the human does.
- Never commit or push, including wrappers. External writes, destructive actions,
  production access, and scope expansion need specific confirmation. Shipping
  ends at a verified local handoff unless separately authorized within these
  limits. Full-autonomy language never overrides permission gates.
- Load pstack-principle-test-behavior-not-implementation before changing tests.
  Keep tests at observable boundaries, justify each by a credible regression,
  and never add test-only production seams. Reviews do not authorize editing.
- Before every test, build, benchmark, or integration run, establish the resource
  baseline. After success, failure, or timeout, require PASS from "Check resources
  after every run" in bundle-root `docs/integration-test-isolation.md`
  (`../../docs/integration-test-isolation.md` from a bundled skill directory).
  Block retries, further runs, and completion claims on FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE.
  Only permitted primary or implementation runners execute checks and authorized
  cleanup. Read-only roles verify receipts or request a permitted runner.
- Bundled scripts are real programs with side effects, not permission bypasses.
  Inspect them before use. The local worktree audit is an inventory, not proof
  of inactivity or permission to delete. Unknown activity requires review.

The upstream text below retains workflow detail. Where it assumes Cursor or
grants broader autonomy, the OpenCode contract above replaces that assumption.


# Interrogate

Spawn one reviewer per configured model to adversarially review code changes. The adversarial signal comes from model diversity, not assigned personas. The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that.
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset.
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files.

Package the diff or file contents with any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent in one clear paragraph from the user's message, commit messages, the PR description if one exists, and the code. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Launch two native `subagent` reviewers in a single message, using the project-local policy tasks below. Label them Reviewer A and Reviewer B.

| Subagent | Policy task |
|----------|---------------|
| Reviewer A | `implementation` |
| Reviewer B | `review` |

Both seats use `agent: poteto-reviewer` with its unchanged read-only permissions. Pass `model` set to the task's exact value in `pstack-models.json`. A task profile changes the model, not the reviewer's authority.

Require distinct provider/model IDs after removing variants. If they match, or a policy model is missing or rejected, report the coverage gap. Do not substitute another model or silently claim multi-model review from fresh contexts. Follow `pstack-runtime` for dispatch rules.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the same template for every reviewer with the stated intent, the diff or file contents, the rubric from `references/rubric.md`, and the code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`. Keep each policy model and variant unchanged.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture. Parse every reviewer's findings. Merge findings that describe the same issue differently, and note which models raised each one. Findings two or more models raised independently are the highest signal. Read a lone model's finding, but weight it accordingly. Note disagreements. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that is context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator. Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework. Put every finding in one of four buckets, with the model(s) that raised it and a one-line rationale.

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. They would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact at this stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context, with a brief reason.

## Output Format

### Intent

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Each: description, which models raised it, the tradeoff.]

### Noted

### Dismissed
[Each with a brief rationale.]

### Agreement Map
[Where models agreed and diverged, and what that pattern tells us.]
