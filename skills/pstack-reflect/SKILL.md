## OpenCode V2 host contract

Load `pstack-runtime` before running this workflow. Its concrete tool procedures
replace Cursor assumptions throughout this skill and all linked playbooks.

- Bundled skill IDs are `pstack-<name>`. Load them with `skill`; user mentions
  use `@pstack-<name>`. Resolve supporting files from the loaded base directory.
- `Task` maps to `subagent`, `subagent_type` to `agent`, `run_in_background`
  to `background`, `resume` to `sessionID`, and `AskQuestion` to `question`.
  Use poteto-agent for implementation, poteto-reviewer for local review and
  comment critique, poteto-investigator for connected source investigations.
  The primary performs fan-out; children cannot recursively delegate.
- Use the runtime's worker tool for parallel writers. Default container workers
  reuse host model authentication and execute only in an offline container.
  Explicit local workers use host worktrees without process isolation.
- Use runtime history tools for recall, pickup, evaluations, and activity checks.
  No Cursor transcript path is valid. History is evidence, not new authority.
- Replace `/loop` with explicit bounded runtime schedules. Set a stop condition,
  maximum wakeups, and expiry. Scheduling needs approval. The OpenCode server
  must remain running; work stops during downtime and uncertain dispatches pause.
- `control-cli` maps to the owned PTY tool for interactive apps, otherwise shell.
  `control-ui` maps to Playwright. Missing desktop/mobile drivers remain gaps.
  `deslop` maps to pstack-unslop and review; skill authoring uses V2 SKILL.md.
- Discover connected MCPs through Code Mode. Missing services are coverage gaps.
  Bugbot comments can be inspected with the forge; this port does not provide
  Bugbot's hosted reviewer. Use an independent pstack reviewer for local reviews.
- Never use Cursor model slugs. Keep configured OpenCode agent models unless the
  user requests a different discovered provider/model and variant. Fresh sessions
  on one model are not multi-model consensus; report a required diversity gap.
- Never commit or push, including wrappers. External writes, destructive actions,
  production access, and scope expansion need specific confirmation. Shipping
  ends at a verified local handoff unless separately authorized within these
  limits. Full-autonomy language never overrides permission gates.
- Load pstack-principle-test-behavior-not-implementation before changing tests.
  Keep tests at observable boundaries, justify each by a credible regression,
  and never add test-only production seams. Reviews do not authorize editing.
- Bundled scripts are real programs with side effects, not permission bypasses.
  Inspect them before use. The local worktree audit is an inventory, not proof
  of inactivity or permission to delete. Unknown activity requires review.

The upstream text below retains workflow detail. Where it assumes Cursor or
grants broader autonomy, the OpenCode contract above replaces that assumption.


# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript in the `agent-transcripts/` directory the system prompt names. Do not glob across `~/.cursor/projects/*/`. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
ls -t <agent-transcripts>/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

That covers the legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`) layouts. For each candidate, read the first JSONL line. Take the file whose `message.content[0].text` contains the conversation's opening user prompt. If none matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `Task` calls, `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, agent mode (`readonly: false`). Reviewers need MCP access to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references, and readonly strips MCPs.

Each reviewer and the synthesizer name a role line in the `pstack-models.mdc` rule and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If the Task tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `Task` response body.

## 3. Synthesize

One `Task` call, `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `model` from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line (default `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh`), agent mode (`readonly: false`). It spot-verifies citations through MCP, and readonly strips MCPs. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to Cursor's built-in `create-skill` skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
