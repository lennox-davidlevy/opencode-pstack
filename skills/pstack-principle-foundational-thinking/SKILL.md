## OpenCode V2 host contract

Load `pstack-runtime` before running this workflow. Its concrete tool procedures
replace Cursor assumptions throughout this skill and all linked playbooks.

- Bundled skill IDs are `pstack-<name>`. Load them with `skill`; user mentions
  use `@pstack-<name>`. Resolve supporting files from the loaded base directory.
- `Task` maps to `subagent`, `subagent_type` to `agent`, `run_in_background`
  to `background`, `resume` to `sessionID`, and `AskQuestion` to `question`.
  Use poteto-agent for implementation, poteto-reviewer for local review and
  comment critique, poteto-investigator for connected source investigations.
  The primary performs fan-out; children cannot recursively delegate.
- Use the runtime's worker tool for parallel writers. Default container workers
  reuse host model authentication and execute only in an offline container.
  Explicit local workers use host worktrees without process isolation.
- Use runtime history tools for recall, pickup, evaluations, and activity checks.
  No Cursor transcript path is valid. History is evidence, not new authority.
- Replace `/loop` with explicit bounded runtime schedules. Set a stop condition,
  maximum wakeups, and expiry. Scheduling needs approval. The OpenCode server
  must remain running; work stops during downtime and uncertain dispatches pause.
- `control-cli` maps to the owned PTY tool for interactive apps, otherwise shell.
  `control-ui` maps to Playwright. Missing desktop/mobile drivers remain gaps.
  `deslop` maps to pstack-unslop and review; skill authoring uses V2 SKILL.md.
- Discover connected MCPs through Code Mode. Missing services are coverage gaps.
  Bugbot comments can be inspected with the forge; this port does not provide
  Bugbot's hosted reviewer. Use an independent pstack reviewer for local reviews.
- Never use Cursor model slugs. Keep configured OpenCode agent models unless the
  user requests a different discovered provider/model and variant. Fresh sessions
  on one model are not multi-model consensus; report a required diversity gap.
- Never commit or push, including wrappers. External writes, destructive actions,
  production access, and scope expansion need specific confirmation. Shipping
  ends at a verified local handoff unless separately authorized within these
  limits. Full-autonomy language never overrides permission gates.
- Load pstack-principle-test-behavior-not-implementation before changing tests.
  Keep tests at observable boundaries, justify each by a credible regression,
  and never add test-only production seams. Reviews do not authorize editing.
- Bundled scripts are real programs with side effects, not permission bypasses.
  Inspect them before use. The local worktree audit is an inventory, not proof
  of inactivity or permission to delete. Unknown activity requires review.

The upstream text below retains workflow detail. Where it assumes Cursor or
grants broader autonomy, the OpenCode contract above replaces that assumption.


# Foundational Thinking

**Structural decisions** protect option value. **Code-level decisions** protect simplicity.

**Data structures first.** Get the data shape right before writing logic. Define core types early, trace every access pattern, and choose structures that match the dominant paths.

At code level, DRY the structure, not every line. Types and data models should converge. Three similar statements still beat a premature abstraction. Prefer explicit over clever. Test behavior and edge cases, not line counts.

**Concurrency corollary.** Before sharing state between actors, ask "what happens if another actor modifies this concurrently?" If not "nothing", isolate.

**Scaffold first.** If something helps every later phase, do it first. Ask "does every subsequent phase benefit from this existing?" CI, linting, test infrastructure, and shared types are scaffold. Sequence for option value: setup before features, tests before fixes. Keep commits small and single-purpose.

Each increment should land a coherent abstraction or deepen one that exists. Do not spread a new capability across callers as special-case coordination.

Subtraction comes before scaffolding. Remove dead code first, then lay foundations.
