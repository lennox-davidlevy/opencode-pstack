## OpenCode V2 host contract

Load `pstack-runtime` before running this workflow. Its concrete tool procedures
replace Cursor assumptions throughout this skill and all linked playbooks.

- Bundled skill IDs are `pstack-<name>`. Load them with `skill`; user mentions
  use `@pstack-<name>`. Resolve supporting files from the loaded base directory.
- `Task` maps to `subagent`, `subagent_type` to `agent`, `run_in_background`
  to `background`, `resume` to `sessionID`, and `AskQuestion` to `question`.
  Use poteto-agent for implementation, poteto-reviewer for local review and
  comment critique, poteto-investigator for connected source investigations.
  The primary performs fan-out; children cannot recursively delegate.
- Use the runtime's worker tool for parallel writers. Default container workers
  reuse host model authentication and execute only in an offline container.
  Explicit local workers use host worktrees without process isolation.
- Use runtime history tools for recall, pickup, evaluations, and activity checks.
  No Cursor transcript path is valid. History is evidence, not new authority.
- Replace `/loop` with explicit bounded runtime schedules. Set a stop condition,
  maximum wakeups, and expiry. Scheduling needs approval. The OpenCode server
  must remain running; work stops during downtime and uncertain dispatches pause.
- `control-cli` maps to the owned PTY tool for interactive apps, otherwise shell.
  `control-ui` maps to Playwright. Missing desktop/mobile drivers remain gaps.
  `deslop` maps to pstack-unslop and review; skill authoring uses V2 SKILL.md.
- Discover connected MCPs through Code Mode. Missing services are coverage gaps.
  Bugbot comments can be inspected with the forge; this port does not provide
  Bugbot's hosted reviewer. Use an independent pstack reviewer for local reviews.
- Never use Cursor model slugs. Keep configured OpenCode agent models unless the
  user requests a different discovered provider/model and variant. Fresh sessions
  on one model are not multi-model consensus; report a required diversity gap.
- Never commit or push, including wrappers. External writes, destructive actions,
  production access, and scope expansion need specific confirmation. Shipping
  ends at a verified local handoff unless separately authorized within these
  limits. Full-autonomy language never overrides permission gates.
- Load pstack-principle-test-behavior-not-implementation before changing tests.
  Keep tests at observable boundaries, justify each by a credible regression,
  and never add test-only production seams. Reviews do not authorize editing.
- Bundled scripts are real programs with side effects, not permission bypasses.
  Inspect them before use. The local worktree audit is an inventory, not proof
  of inactivity or permission to delete. Unknown activity requires review.

The upstream text below retains workflow detail. Where it assumes Cursor or
grants broader autonomy, the OpenCode contract above replaces that assumption.


# Minimize Reader Load

Maintainability is the work a reader must do to understand code. Track two axes: **layers to trace** (indirections between the question and the answer) and **state to hold** (hidden or mutable context the reader must keep in their head). LOC, cyclomatic complexity, and "clean architecture" are proxies. Reader load is the thing that matters. The two axes are independent. A flat file with 50 globals can be as hard to reason about as a 6-layer adapter stack. Guard both. This is the human analog of [Guard the Context Window](../pstack-principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md). Working memory is finite for readers too.

- **Collapse layers** that cost more than they save: wrappers with one caller, adapters with no second implementation, speculative indirection that was never needed. Inline them.
- **Make adjacent layers change the abstraction.** A layer that repeats the same methods and arguments adds reader load without compression. Collapse pass-through layers.
- **Demand interface compression.** A broad interface that hides little complexity makes readers learn both the surface and the implementation. Prefer boundaries that hide meaningful decisions.
- **Shrink state scope:** prefer pure functions (returns over mutations), locals over fields, fields over module state, and module state over globals. Derive instead of sync.
- **Name the invariant at the boundary,** not in every consumer, so the reader learns it once.
- Before adding a layer or a piece of state, ask: does it reduce reader load elsewhere by at least as much?

**The test:** can a new reader answer "where does X come from?" and "what can change X?" in under 30 seconds? If not, cut layers or cut state.
