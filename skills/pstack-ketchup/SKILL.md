## OpenCode V2 host contract

Load `pstack-runtime` before running this workflow. Its concrete tool procedures
replace Cursor assumptions throughout this skill and all linked playbooks.

- Bundled skill IDs are `pstack-<name>`. Load them with `skill`; user mentions
  use `@pstack-<name>`. Resolve supporting files from the loaded base directory.
- `Task` maps to `subagent`, `subagent_type` to `agent`, `run_in_background`
  to `background`, `resume` to `sessionID`, and `AskQuestion` to `question`.
  Use poteto-agent for implementation, poteto-reviewer for local review and
  comment critique, poteto-investigator for connected source investigations.
  The primary performs fan-out; children cannot recursively delegate.
  Keep at most two active children across owners, runners, and reviewers.
  Retained live resources and uncertain acquisitions still consume capacity.
  Plan larger panels in bounded waves, never by raising this aggregate ceiling.
- Use the runtime's worker tool for parallel writers. Default container workers
  reuse host model authentication and execute only in an offline container.
  Explicit local workers use host worktrees without process isolation.
- Use runtime history tools for recall, pickup, evaluations, and activity checks.
  No Cursor transcript path is valid. History is evidence, not new authority.
- Replace `/loop` with explicit bounded runtime schedules. Set a stop condition,
  maximum wakeups, and expiry. Scheduling needs approval. The OpenCode server
  must remain running; work stops during downtime and uncertain dispatches pause.
- `control-cli` maps to the owned PTY tool for interactive apps, otherwise shell.
  `control-ui` maps to Playwright. Missing desktop/mobile drivers remain gaps.
  `deslop` maps to pstack-unslop and review; skill authoring uses V2 SKILL.md.
- Discover connected MCPs through Code Mode. Missing services are coverage gaps.
  Bugbot comments can be inspected with the forge; this port does not provide
  Bugbot's hosted reviewer. Use an independent pstack reviewer for local reviews.
- Read project-local `pstack-models.json` before selecting delegate models. Its
  six tasks are coordination, implementation, hard, investigation, review, and
  mechanical. The user-approved policy authorizes those exact discovered
  `provider/model#variant` values. Never invent a fallback or adjust a suffix.
- For native `subagent` calls, choose the task and pass its exact policy value as
  `model`. Keep the agent role and permissions appropriate to the work. Workers
  accept optional `task`, default from the role through policy `defaults`, and
  resolve the model themselves. Neither path forces the parent's model. See
  `pstack-runtime` for selection details. Missing or rejected models are gaps.
- Panels start with the implementation and review task models. Require distinct
  configured model IDs, not just variants or fresh contexts. Report diversity
  gaps without substituting an unapproved model. No `panels` key is needed.
- Use `pstack-setup-pstack` to change project policy and synchronize agent defaults.
  This does not switch an existing session's selected model. Only the human does.
- Never commit or push, including wrappers. External writes, destructive actions,
  production access, and scope expansion need specific confirmation. Shipping
  ends at a verified local handoff unless separately authorized within these
  limits. Full-autonomy language never overrides permission gates.
- Load pstack-principle-test-behavior-not-implementation before changing tests.
  Keep tests at observable boundaries, justify each by a credible regression,
  and never add test-only production seams. Reviews do not authorize editing.
- Before every test, build, benchmark, or integration run, establish the resource
  baseline. After success, failure, or timeout, require PASS from "Check resources
  after every run" in bundle-root `docs/integration-test-isolation.md`
  (`../../docs/integration-test-isolation.md` from a bundled skill directory).
  Block retries, further runs, and completion claims on FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE.
  Only permitted primary or implementation runners execute checks and authorized
  cleanup. Read-only roles verify receipts or request a permitted runner.
- Bundled scripts are real programs with side effects, not permission bypasses.
  Inspect them before use. The local worktree audit is an inventory, not proof
  of inactivity or permission to delete. Unknown activity requires review.

The upstream text below retains workflow detail. Where it assumes Cursor or
grants broader autonomy, the OpenCode contract above replaces that assumption.


# Ketchup

Catch the user up on what changed in this chat since the last message they wrote before `/ketchup`, and help them understand each change, not only where it stands. Notifications and subagent results are not their messages. Assume the user remembers their last message and nothing after it.

Use [`/bro`](../pstack-bro/SKILL.md)'s voice, not its task: plain words, short sentences, no jargon, like one person catching up another. Say what changed for the user, not how you did it. Say "the tests pass", not "CI is green". Leave out hashes, file paths, commands, build numbers, and test counts unless the user needs one to act. Call each PR, branch, or agent by a name the user would know, not by a label you invented. If a fact needs context to make sense, give the context or leave the fact out.

## Gather what changed

Keep this turn read-only. Make visuals only from what you already have: do not change code, start an app or a job, or post anything. Collect your own work since that message, reports from subagents, and messages from anyone else in this chat. Check the current state of each PR, CI run, or agent this chat touched. Check each number you will show against the facts it comes from, and say so when you correct one.

An action item is a decision or step only the user can take, such as a product choice, an approval, an irreversible action, or access you lack. Include any still waiting on the user, even one raised before their last message. Work you can still do yourself is not an action item. Never make up a call to fill the reply. A step the user did not ask for and the work does not need is not an action item, unless it is irreversible and waiting on the user: give it one action line, no visual, and skip what happens if the user does not answer.

## Write the reply

Keep the whole reply well under 150 words, not counting visuals. When something is easier to grasp as a picture than as sentences, draw it: how a design or system works, a PR stack or dependency chain with each PR's state, a before and after of a fix, or options side by side. Never draw a status list or boxes with nothing connecting them. Never give a fact twice, in text or across visuals. Leave out work that changed nothing for the user. When words run short, cut from what happened before you cut from the action items.

Open with one sentence that says how many things need the user, or that nothing does. If nothing happened and nothing waits on the user, say so and stop.

Then show what happened, pictures first. Embed inline the screenshots and videos the work produced, then any diagram that explains a change. Then sum up in one short bullet per thing the user asked for: what came of it, and whether it is done, still running, failed, or not checked. Write each line the way you would say it out loud: "Search was slow from a missing index", not "Search review: done" or "Slow search: missing index". Name any bug found and fixed on the way. Each line must stay true when read alone. Never mark something done that still waits on the user, and leave out anything the action items say. Under the summary, give at most three short lines that change what the user knows or must do. Then name in one line any work left that you can do yourself.

Then list the action items as plain bullets, never as a diagram or box. Give each two lines, or one for an unasked irreversible step: the decision with your recommendation and why, then what happens if the user does not answer. Ask the call the user owns, such as merge, approve, or pick. A step you would take first goes in your recommendation. So does anything that must happen first, and anything that cannot be undone. Write "unknown" for a part you do not know. Link to the detail.

Show a choice after the list. If the screenshots above already show its options, write each option's gain and cost under its screenshot instead of drawing a new visual; otherwise, compare the options side by side, with the current state when there is one. Give every option the work weighed, each with what it gets the user and what it costs. Keep them out of the rest of the text.

## Visuals

A visual is a picture: a screenshot, a video, a Mermaid diagram, a chart or diagram from `/visualize`, or a generated image. A Markdown table is not a visual, even with before and after columns.

Keep each visual small enough to read at a glance: at most six boxes, with at most eight words in each. Write labels as plain words a person would say, not tags like "Tests: pass". A fact that needs a sentence belongs in the text, or nowhere.

Embed screenshots and videos inline when the change is visible, not only as links. If a visible change has none, mark its summary line "No screenshot yet," and say there what changed on screen. Draw diagrams and charts from facts you have: a Mermaid diagram for how things connect and a `/visualize` chart for numbers. Never invent a number, and never draw or generate a picture of a screen you did not capture. Link only artifacts that exist.
